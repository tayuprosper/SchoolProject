# SchoolProject
DRestau is a school project static website that could be used as a digital restaurant where people can buy food and items and it will be delivered to them.
# Project Folder Structure
this project has three folders and the first is issues. this folder is where you give comments on the project. for example someone makes a change that you dont think is right you can onpen the the description file inside of the issues folder and comment on the issue. start a new issue where oders have ended. add to empty lines start with a "#"beside your name then below that state your issue. we shall talk about any issue together on the WhatsApp forum and decide.
Next Folder is Static. this is where all images on our website will resite. when you clone this page the first time and you want to add images add it only inside the images folder and also remeber to add a suitable name for your image. there is already an image inside and that is the design we will take for our landing page for now do not bother about how fancy the paage looks we will get there gradualy. I will send a breakdown of the design for just html without the styling in the group.
Next folder is the webpages folder this is where all our html pages will go. we might still change or add sub folders inside this folder but for now we will leave it like this.
# Note 
download a suitable code editor like visual studio code to start.
